Embedding Visualizer (EmbedViz) is a miniature version of Tensorflow Embedding projector made using [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) library.

_Streamlit is an awesome new tool that allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything. If you know Python, youâ€™re good to go! Read more at https://lnkd.in/grV97PB_

### EmbedViz let's you...
1. Choose pre-loaded or Upload custom Word Embeddings
2. Apply Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, TSNE
3. Plot 2D/3D plot
4. Find a word in the space

__P.S. No Web component knowledge is required ;) It's just Python__

## Getting Started
```
> git clone https://github.com/prakhar21/EmbedViz-Streamlit
> pip install streamlit
> streamlit run embedding_viz.py
```

## Things to do
1. Implement TSNE function
2. Write Blog

## Future Prospects
1. Add __KNN__ search for neighbourhood lookup.
2. Adding more dimensions such as __size and color gradient__.
3. Robust to handeling large data.
